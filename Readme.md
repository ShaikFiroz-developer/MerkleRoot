I am Firoz Shaik, a blockchain technology enthusiast and MERN full-stack web developer.

## Completed Tasks

### Task 1: Merkle Proof Verification of Blockchain Transactions

I dedicated an entire day to completing this task, putting in my 100% effort. The project demonstrates my commitment to delivering quality work. The technology stack includes:

- **Frontend:** Vite + React
- **Blockchain Development:** Solidity, Truffle, Ganache
- **API Access:** Infura (account creation and API key required for blockchain data access)

### Task 2: Notification Bot for Tracking USDC Transfers to a Specific Address

This task was less time-consuming compared to Task 1, focused more on developing the core logic. I created a simple UI using Embedded JavaScript Templates (EJS) and **Express.js**.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation for both tasks can be found in their respective `README.md` files. I am readily available to address any questions or provide clarifications regarding these projects.
